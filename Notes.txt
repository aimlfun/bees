In comparison, the eyes of bees are much less sensitive to red light, but can see light in the near UV range. Furthermore, the region of the eye that is usually oriented towards the sky is also sensitive to the polarisation of light

Because of the different range of colours, how a bee can see flowers actually looks entirely different for them than they do to us. One of the main differences is the ultraviolet markings
the flowers have. These are like a bullseye guiding the bee into the centre of the flower. This is important so the bee can access the pollen and nectar quickly, and the flower can be properly pollinated.

As well as the ultraviolet guiding system, flowers also attract bees in with an electric charge. As the bees fly through the air, they build a positive charge, while the flowers are negatively charged.
This guides the bees towards the flowers. It also helps the pollen be drawn into the bee’s fur from the flowers. Think of it as your hair being pulled up towards a balloon with static electricity.

THEY CAN COVER 1,500 FLOWERS IN A DAY

A bee would need to fly 90,000 miles to create just one pound of honey but when they make their trip, they don't complete it in one go. Instead, they will leave the hive around 15 times a day and visit around 100 flowers on each

A bee visits around 100 flowers per foraging flight, with a maximum speed of up to 30 kilometres per hour. With ten foraging flights per day, this equates to 1,000 flowers. With a maximum of 40 flights per day, however, considerably more is possible.
